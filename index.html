                knowledge, skills, values, morals, beliefs, and habits. Educational methods include teaching, training,
                storytelling, discussion and directed research. Education frequently takes place under the guidance of
                educators, however learners can also educate themselves.</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">After the Fall of Rome, the Catholic Church became the sole preserver of
                literate scholarship in Western Europe.[9] The church established cathedral schools in the Early Middle
                Ages as centres of advanced education. Some of these establishments ultimately evolved into medieval
                universities and forebears of many of Europe's modern universities.[4] During the High Middle Ages,
                Chartres Cathedral operated the famous and influential Chartres Cathedral School. </p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education began in prehistory, as adults trained the young in the
                knowledge and skills deemed necessary in their society. In pre-literate societies, this was achieved
                orally and through imitation. Story-telling passed knowledge, values, and skills from one generation to
                the next. As cultures began to extend their knowledge beyond skills that could be readily learned
                through imitation, formal education developed. Schools existed in Egypt at the time of the Middle
                Kingdom.[2]
